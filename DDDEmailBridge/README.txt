If your DDD release is DDD 4.0 SP1 or earlier, you need to patch your DDD Server for the DDD Email Bridge 
to work properly with it.  Complete the following steps:

Copy Aptima.Asim.DDD.CommonComponents.DataTypeTools.dll from the "DDD 4.0 patch" directory to "C:\Program Files\Aptima\DDD 4.0\Server"
Copy Aptima.Asim.DDD.CommonComponents.SimulationEventTools.dll from the "DDD 4.0 patch" directory to "C:\Program Files\Aptima\DDD 4.0\Server"
Copy SimulationModel.xml from the "DDD 4.0 patch" directory to "C:\Program Files\Aptima\DDD 4.0\Client" (or wherever your DDDClient shared directory is located).
