<h1>Introduction to Teams</h1>
<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Team</span>
is defined as a grouping of <a href="Decision%20Makers.html">Decision Makers</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;Team, is defined in terms of the other teams it is hostile to.
&nbsp;A Team may be hostile to itself, as in the case of "friendly
fire". &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, a Team's
hostility need not be <span style="font-style: italic;">symmetric</span>.
&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;the "Northern Coalition" may be defined
as
hostile to the "Delian League", however the "Delian League" may not
necessary be defined as hostile to&nbsp;the "Nothern Coalition".</p>
<p>A Decision
Maker's team membership is defined in the Decision Maker
Section.</p>
<p></p>
