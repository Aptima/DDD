            <summary>
            The GoColor structure represents a color in five different color models,
            RGB, CMY, CMYK, HSB, and HSL.  Each of the components of the color models
            can be modified to change the represented color.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            There are a number of static (shared) methods to easily construct a GoColor
            from a System.Drawing.Color or from color values in the different color models.

            <para>
            These part specifiers are ignored for most GoObject properties,
            since those property values are simple values, such as booleans, enumerations,
            floating-point numbers, strings, or Colors,
            and hence do not have parts that could be set separately.

            Although this enumeration helps distinguish subproperties of a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>,
