            The NetworkClient should be instantiated once per client application.
            It is used to subscribe to and receive events from the DDD Server.
            It is also used to send events to the DDD Server.

            This method should be called to determine if the NetworkClient object is connected
            to the DDD Server.  If for some reason the connection is lost, this will return false.
